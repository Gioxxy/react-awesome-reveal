[React Awesome Reveal](https://github.com/dennismorello/react-awesome-reveal) is a library for React apps written in TypeScript that adds reveal animations using the Intersection Observer API to detect when the elements appear in the viewport. Animations are provided by [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) to benefit from hardware acceleration.

## Features

- üéÅ **Modern stack** - It is built for modern React
- üè∑ **TypeScript support** - It is written in TypeScript to make it easier and faster to use the library
- üçÉ **Lightweight** - Very little footprint on your project ([~1kB gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-awesome-reveal))
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Uses native APIs** - Intersection Observer and CSS Animations are now supported by all major browsers
- üöÄ **Fast** - Buttery smooth experience thanks to the use of native asynchronous APIs and hardware acceleration
- üå≥ **Tree-shakeable** - Only the parts you use will be included in your final bundle

## Installation

To add this package as a dependency to your app, simply run

```sh
npm install react-awesome-reveal --save
```

or, if you are using Yarn (as I strongly suggest):

```sh
yarn add react-awesome-reveal
```

You must also include [Animated.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) in your HTML file:

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.7.2/animate.min.css"
  />
</head>
```

## Quick Start

Import effects from [React Awesome Reveal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-awesome-reveal) to your React component, for example the `Fade` effect:

```js
import { Fade } from 'react-awesome-reveal';
```

Then simply wrap the components you want to animate:

```jsx
<Fade>
  <p>I will gently appear as I enter the viewport</p>
</Fade>
```

## Supported Effects

The effects currently supported are `Bounce`, `Fade`, `Flash`, `Flip`, `HeadShake`, `HeartBeat`, `JackInTheBox`, `Jello`, `LightSpeed`, `Pulse`, `Rotate`, `RubberBand`, `Shake`, `Slide`, `Swing`, `Tada`, `Wobble` and `Zoom`.

You can pass the following properties to the animation components to customize the behavior:

| Prop          | Description                                                                                                 | Values                                                                                             | Default     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `direction`   | Origin of the animation                                                                                     | `"top"`, `"left"`, `"bottom"` or `"right"`                                                         | `undefined` |
| `delay`       | Milliseconds to wait before the animation starts                                                            | `"1s"`, `"2s"`, `"3s"`, `"4s"`, `"5s"` or a `number` in milliseconds                               | `undefined` |
| `fraction`    | How much an element should be in viewport before the animation is triggered                                 | `number` between `0` and `1`                                                                       | `0`         |
| `speed`       | Affects the animation duration                                                                              | `"slower"` (3s), `"slow"` (2s), `"fast"` (800ms), `"faster"` (500ms) or a `number` in milliseconds | `1000`      |
| `triggerOnce` | Specifies if the animation should run only once or everytime an element enters/exits/re-enters the viewport | `true` or `false`                                                                                  | `false`     |
| `className`   | Class names to add to the wrapper element (e.g. to add custom animations)                                   | `string` value                                                                                     | `undefined` |
| `style`       | Style object to add inline styles to the wrapper element                                                    | `object` value                                                                                     | `undefined` |

### Example

To trigger the animation only the first time an element enters the viewport:

```jsx
<Slide triggerOnce>
  <p>I will animate only the first time you see me </p>
</Slide>
```

### Chaining Multiple Animations

To chain together multiple animations, you can play with the `delay` prop:

```jsx
<Fade>
  <p>I enter first...</p>
</Fade>
<Fade delay="1s">
  <p>...then comes my turn...</p>
</Fade>
<Fade delay="2s">
  <p>...and finally you see me!</p>
</Fade>
```

> In the future, chained animations will be handled by a specific API ‚Äì stay tuned!
