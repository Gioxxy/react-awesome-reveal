# Quick Start

Import effects from the `react-awesome-reveal` package to your React component, for example the `Fade` effect:

```jsx
import { Fade } from "react-awesome-reveal";
```

Then simply wrap the components you want to animate:

```jsx
<Fade>
  <p>I will gently appear as I enter the viewport</p>
</Fade>
```
