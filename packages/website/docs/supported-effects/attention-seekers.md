# Attention Seekers

Since version 3, attention seeker animations are wrapped by the `AttentionSeeker` component, which accepts a prop called `effect` that specifies the animation to render (defaults to `"bounce”`). The supported effects are: `”bounce"`, `"flash"`, `"headShake”`, `"heartBeat"`, `"jello”`, `"pulse"`, `"rubberBand"`, `“shake”`, `“shakeX"`, `"shakeY”`, `"swing”`, `"tada"` and `“wobble”`.

Again, refer to the [Animate.css](https://animate.style) documentation for the details.
